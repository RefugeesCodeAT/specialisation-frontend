      <p> not a half lover, nor befriend a half friend
        Indulge not in the work of the half-talented
        Live not a half life, nor die a half death
        Choose not a half solution, nor stand in the middle of a truth
        Dream not a half dream, nor cling to a half hope
        If you choose to be silent, be silent to the end
        And if you choose to speak, speak to the end
        Let not your silence speak for you, nor your speech silence you
        If you agree, express your agreement, do not feign your acceptance
        A half life is a life you have not lived, a word you have not said, a smile you have not expressed,
        A love you have not felt, and a friendship you have not known</p>

      <p> half life makes you a stranger to intimates, and your intimates strangers
        A half life is what you reach but never attain and where you strive but never succeed
        It is where you are both absent and present
        It is where you are not yourself, for you have never known yourself
        And thus whom you love is not your true soul mate
        A half life is where you are present in different places at the same time
        A half drink does not satisfy your thirst, nor a half meal your hunger
        A half path leads you nowhere, and a half thought yields no result
        A half life is a moment of weakness, but you are not weak, for you are not a half person
        You are a person! You exist to live a full life, not a half life.</p>
